<h3>Overview of the tools</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all in one installer. One of the best is <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a> by Continuum Analytics.

    <h4>Jupyter Notebook</h4>
    <p>The <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Labs</a> is a browser-based interface for interactive computing. Jupyter Labs
      has support for over 100 programming languages, including those popular in Data Science such R, Julia, Scala -  and most importantly, Python. 
      Individual notebooks are composable, executable, and sharable documents 
      that mix text, code, data, and visualizations. Jupyter Labs comes pre-loaded
      in <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda.</a> </p>
    <h4>SQL</h4>
    <p>
      SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases. SQL is a <i>declarative</i> 
      langauge for describing (declaring) the data you want from the database.
      We use <a href="https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt">SQLite Studio</a> for the lessons. There are often memory allocation limits built into most web browsers
      It is a relatively small application with a very intutitive GUI.

      camp.)
    </p>
    <ol>

        Download the installer that matches your operating
        system and save it in your home folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open a terminal window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
        tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
        appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press enter. You will follow the text-only
        prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the

        text. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve
        the license. Press enter to approve the default
        location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to
        your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda
        distribution the default Python).
